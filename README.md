# Skills visualization tool

This project was carried out during my final year of engineering studies. In a team of four, our objective was to develop a tool allowing a learner, on an online learning platform, to be able to visualize a set of skills represented by a hierarchy on a web interface. We also had interoperability constraints. Indeed, our tool must be able to be easily integrated into existing LMS such as the Moodle platform, which was achieved by implementing the LTI protocol, designed for this purpose.

This project was rich in contributions, I was able to develop my user experience design skills since creating a simple and intuitive interface was a challenge here. In addition, I was able to gain experience on the technology stack we used (React / Spring). Finally, as project manager, I was responsible for project management (agile methodology) and listening to the client's demanding needs.

## Features

Our web application will offer the following features:

- Detailed visualization of skills with multiple levels
- Personalized user interface with the possibility of customization
- Interaction between the user and the interface
- Data security
